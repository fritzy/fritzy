### üìì Notable Projects

[SleekXMPP](https://github.com/fritzy/sleekxmpp) (deprecated) was a Python 2.x XMPP protocol library that was heavily used the power industry, used on game consoles, used for the examples in [XMPP: The Definitive Guide published by O'Reilly](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/xmpp-the-definitive/9780596157524/). When I stopped doing as much Python, Python 3 came out, and I made it Python 3 compatible, but never fully converted it over. A Python 3 fork called [SliXMPP](https://github.com/poezio/slixmpp) was made, and I recommend that instead.

[staydown](https://github.com/fritzy/staydown) is a JS module that I wish more people would use because so many applications get chatlog scrolling and user-intention incorrect. `staydown` makes it pretty straight forward.

[spacewar.pro](https://spacewar.pro) [spacewar.pro source](https://github.com/fritzy/spacewar.pro) is a tribute to the DOS version of SPACEWAR.EXE from the '80s. It was an exersize in finishing a small game, and I open sourced it.

[@fritzy/ecs](https://github.com/fritzy/ecs-js) is my current open source work to make a performant and power Entity-Component-System JS library that provides Entity References and powerful/fast queries. It's most useful for simulations and games. The current work is being done in the `lightweight` branch.

[Dulcimer](https://github.com/fritzy/Dulcimer) and it's dependency [VeryModel](https://github.com/fritzy/VeryModel) was an ORM wrapper for leveldb. It managed relationships in a very primitive embedded object store allowing you to write advanced queries. It gained some popularity and we actively used it at [&yet](https://andyet.com) for bots and small projects. I enjoy pointing it out to people when they say, "I could write my own small NoSQL database." You could, but it's more work than you might think. Related: [gatepost](https://github.com/fritzy/gatepost) (VeryModel for Postgresql queries) and [goalpost](https://github.com/fritzy/goalpost) (use Postgresql as an object store, unfinished).
