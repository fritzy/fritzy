## Why You Should Hire Nathan Fritz

üëã Hi, I'm Nathan Fritz, aka [@fritzy](https://twitter.com/fritzy), and I've been a web developer and architect for more than 20 years. I'll take your team and projects to the next level.

The through-line of passion of success in my career has been enabling other developers. I enjoy creating tools, libraries, and services that help developers focus on solving their core problems. I mentor, present, teach, and encourage developers to new heights. I thrive on self-directed learning and then applying it to enable my peers.

## I Love Software Architecture

I have a deep understanding of performance, service architecture, and software development approaches. I believe that software lives and dies on writing services that are understandable, scalable, and maintainable.

* I recently wrote about my [Web Architecture Core Beliefs](https://dev.to/fritzy/.one-web-architect-s-core-beliefs-335f)
* I've developed and assisted in development of countless web APIs as a consultant.
* I'm passionate about defensive coding, and can help your team write more secure software.
* I'm intimately familiar with OAuth2. For example, I wrote the first Alexa Skill for AT&T SMS Messaging, involving a dual-linked OAuth2 workflow between both services.

## I'm Passionate about Databases

* I provided paid training sessions at the world's first [RedisConf (2012)](https://blog.andyet.com/2012/09/23/were-keeping-it-realtime-conference/).
* I've written a lot of articles exploring PostgreSQL.
    * [Creating a Document-Store Hybrid in Postgres 9.5](https://blog.andyet.com/2016/02/04/postgres-9.5-document-store-hybrid/)
    * [Generating URL-Safe Short IDs in Postgresql](https://blog.andyet.com/2016/02/23/generating-shortids-in-postgres/)
    * [Postgres‚Äôs publish-subscribe features made better with JSON](https://blog.andyet.com/2015/04/06/postgres-pubsub-with-json/)
* In 2004, I scaled MySQL based shopping card to serve a massive influx of traffic when [LoveSac's founder won a reality tv show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rebel_Billionaire:_Branson%27s_Quest_for_the_Best).
* I helped AT&T scale Riak for massive message storage.
* I'm an expert in distributed databases and I believe in understanding clustered database guarantees.

## I Nerd Out Over Protocols and Messaging
 
 * My Python XMPP library [SleekXMPP](https://github.com/fritzy/sleekxmpp) has been used in major game consoles, extensively in the solar industry, the official [XMPP Book](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/xmpp-the-definitive/9780596157524/), and more.
 * I've built out reliable job systems to distribute work for major companies.
 * I've created implementations of AMQP.
 * I have intimate knowledge of HTTP 1, 2, and I'm currently diving into HTTP/3/QUIC.

## I've Been Writing A Lot of Node.js

I've been writing in Node.js since v0.4.11 in 2011. The [consultancy that I worked at for the 2010s](https://andyet.com) focused on Node.js where I worked with dozens of companies on Node.js based services.

* I've published [25 public Node.js modules](https://www.npmjs.com/~fritzy).
* I wrote an ORM for embedded leveldb and Riak databases called [Dulcimer](https://github.com/fritzy/dulcimer) in Node.js.
* In 2015, I took a bunch of my experimental ideas and libraries to create a forum API called [Yeti Threads](https://blog.andyet.com/2015/09/02/yeti-threads-case-study-pt-1/).

## On Teams

I believe in writing code for my team-mates first and the computer second. I believe in being empathetic to my co-workers in order to enable comfortable and productive workplaces. I believe in elevating those around me in happiness, productivity, and knowledge.

## About You

You care about your people. In fact, it's part of your mission or vision statements. You're looking for someone to create technical solutions that can be maintained long term. You're looking for someone to build your teams up and achieve more.

If this sounds like you, please reach out.
